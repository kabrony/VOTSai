# TRILOGY Brain Documentation

Welcome to the TRILOGY Brain documentation. This system provides advanced AI capabilities through a neural interface with both local and API-based models.

## Overview

TRILOGY Brain is a modular AI orchestration system designed to provide:

1. **Flexible Model Integration**: Seamlessly use local Ollama models alongside API-based models like Claude and DeepSeek
2. **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically select the best model for any given query
3. **Memory System**: Maintain context across conversations for more coherent interactions
4. **Matrix-inspired UI**: A cyberpunk-styled terminal interface for interacting with the system
5. **Advanced Code Analysis**: Analyze and improve code snippets

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```
   streamlit run trilogy_app.py
   ```

3. Access the UI at http://localhost:8501

## Architecture

TRILOGY Brain follows a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Core**: Central orchestration system
- **Models**: Integrations with various AI models
- **UI**: User interface components
- **Utils**: Utility functions and helpers
- **Docs**: Documentation files

See the [architecture.md](architecture.md) file for detailed information.
