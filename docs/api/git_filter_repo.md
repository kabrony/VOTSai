# git_filter_repo

git-filter-repo filters git repositories, similar to git filter-branch, BFG
repo cleaner, and others.  The basic idea is that it works by running
   git fast-export <options> | filter | git fast-import <options>
where this program not only launches the whole pipeline but also serves as
the 'filter' in the middle.  It does a few additional things on top as well
in order to make it into a well-rounded filtering tool.

git-filter-repo can also be used as a library for more involved filtering
operations; however:
  ***** API BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY CAVEAT *****
  Programs using git-filter-repo as a library can reach pretty far into its
  internals, but I am not prepared to guarantee backward compatibility of
  all APIs.  I suspect changes will be rare, but I reserve the right to
  change any API.  Since it is assumed that repository filtering is
  something one would do very rarely, and in particular that it's a
  one-shot operation, this should not be a problem in practice for anyone.
  However, if you want to re-use a program you have written that uses
  git-filter-repo as a library (or makes use of one of its --*-callback
  arguments), you should either make sure you are using the same version of
  git and git-filter-repo, or make sure to re-test it.

  If there are particular pieces of the API you are concerned about, and
  there is not already a testcase for it in t9391-lib-usage.sh or
  t9392-python-callback.sh, please contribute a testcase.  That will not
  prevent me from changing the API, but it will allow you to look at the
  history of a testcase to see whether and how the API changed.
