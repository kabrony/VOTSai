# _add_newdocs

This is only meant to add docs to objects defined in C-extension modules.
The purpose is to allow easier editing of the docstrings without
requiring a re-compile.

NOTE: Many of the methods of ndarray have corresponding functions.
      If you update these docstrings, please keep also the ones in
      _core/fromnumeric.py, matrixlib/defmatrix.py up-to-date.
