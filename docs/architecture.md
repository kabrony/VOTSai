## Core Components

### TrilogyBrain

The central orchestration system that manages:
- Model selection
- Query processing
- Memory integration
- Response generation

### Router

Responsible for:
- Analyzing queries
- Selecting optimal models
- Tracking performance metrics
- Intelligent routing based on query characteristics

### MemorySystem

Handles:
- Short and long-term memory
- Context retrieval
- Memory pruning
- Semantic search

## Model Integrations

### ModelRegistry

Manages:
- Model registration
- Configuration
- Initialization
- Status tracking

### OllamaModel

Provides:
- Local model execution
- Model listing
- Availability checks
- Chat and completion interfaces

### External API Models

Integrations with:
- Claude API
- DeepSeek API
- Other API-based models

## UI Components

### MatrixTerminal

Provides:
- Matrix-inspired terminal interface
- Typing animations
- Code highlighting
- Themed UI components

### Dashboard

Displays:
- System metrics
- Model performance
- Recent activity
- System status

## Data Flow

1. **Query Submission**: User submits a query through the UI
2. **Query Analysis**: Router analyzes the query characteristics
3. **Model Selection**: System selects the optimal model
4. **Memory Integration**: Relevant memories are retrieved
5. **Query Processing**: Selected model processes the query
6. **Response Generation**: System formats and returns the response
7. **Memory Update**: System updates memory with the new interaction
8. **Telemetry**: Usage statistics are recorded

## Integration Points

- **Configuration System**: Central config files for system settings
- **Telemetry**: Usage tracking and performance monitoring
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and analysis
- **API Endpoints**: Optional REST API for programmatic access

## Extensibility

The system is designed for extensibility:
- New models can be added to the registry
- Custom routers can be implemented
- Memory systems can be replaced with alternate implementations
- UI components can be customized or replaced
